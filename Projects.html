        <p>As a senior, I worked with a team of 3 students for a client, Professor Mary Ruppert-Stroescu from the Sam Fox School of Arts. Dr. Ruppert-Stroescu wanted a way to make fashionable shirts equipped with an EKG sensor to monitor the wearer's heart. After extensively exploring the options, we decided to build a shirt that used conductive silver fabric woven into an elastic band that could measure an EKG with medical-grade accuracy that is comfortable and hypoallergenic. The circuit on the shirt utilizes a set of filters and a shunt AD8232 chipped raspberry Pi Pico to process the data and send it to a HIPPAA-Compliant SQL Server. The shirt is powered by a small battery pack that can be charged via USB-C and can last for up to 60 hours.</p>
          <p>
          We went through the SlingHealth venture cycle and presented our poster at National Demo Day. We also presented our work at at Wash U's annual "BME Day". We won third place in the BME Day competition, and our project website summarizing our work can be found <a href="https://sites.wustl.edu/ecgshirt/">here</a>.</p>

        <p>While a junior, I was invited to collaborate on a senior design project focused on urologic surgery. The
          client for the senior project, Dr. Nimrod at the Washington University School of Medicine, wanted a solution
          that could detect Iatrogenic Ureteral Injury during an operation. I worked with the team to come up with
          different instrumentation methods, and helped develop and prototype a solution. We considered infrared, x-ray,
          and ultrasound among other ideas until eventually settling on temperature sensing. The idea is for an array of
          thermocouples/thermistors to be placed at various locations near the ureter and inside the stent. This way, if
          one region starts to heat up, we can determine if the scalpel is nearing the ureter and trigger a buzzer or
          other intervention to signal that the scalpel should be removed.</p>

        <p>For the final group project in CSE 237, I as well as another Sophomore and Junior decided to build an
          Arduino Assembly Interpreter written in Java.
          CSE 237 is a class on programming tools and techniques, so one of the main intentions of the project was to
          adhere to clean code techniques and best practice planning and contribution
          models. This included the use of branching and pull requests, a Kanban board, code review, and external peer
          review.
        </p>

        <p>The Arduino Assembly interpreter is able to take in a .S assembly file for the AVR instruction set
          (specifically for the Arduino Uno), and then
          interprets the file and runs it through a virtual CPU to follow the instructions. By the end of the
          semester, the interpreter was able to run assembly files containing basic arithmetic instructions, simple function calls, and branching.
        </p>

        <p>An repository of our team's completed project can be found <a
            href="https://github.com/CSE237SP2022/project-viswanathan-jaff-rose">here</a>. Additionally, as a side
          project this summer, I'm looking to rewrite a version of this in C as practice for my internship at Garmin
          where I have to write a lot of C code.</p>

        <p></p>
        <p>Over my spring break, I chose to stay at University instead of go anywhere fun. While I was there,
          I challenged myself to write a full stack app for my idea of a speedrunning party game. The
          premise is simple enough; a group of friends can go to a website where they can select a few video games,
          input the types of challenges they want, and then a full fledged interface pits people in the group against
          each other in video game challenges.

          <br>
          <br>

          This one app, however, is actually two! There's a "community app" and a "game app." Both
          sites share a common database, and the community app is designed to build and filter out challenges in a
          reddit-like forum, while the game uses the database to actually host the games. The app is open source and
          thus can be "off-the-grid," meaning that anyone who wants to host this
          version of the app on their local network and keep their own SQLite game database could do that if say a
          streamer
          wanted to use the app off-network to avoid low-quality submission on a stream.

          <br>
          <br>

          For the "community app," I took this as an opportunity to learn Django, and I can confidently say that I do
          not like Django. Well, I don't dislike Django specifically, it seems really powerful but I find it really
          confusing and inflexible. It seems like the framework is built for exactly one type of thing, and if your
          website doesn't want to do that one thing, you'll be stuck writing hundreds of custom functions to get basic
          things working. In hindsight, I could've tried using Flask, Ruby on Rails, or Meteor, but I had reasons to
          be wary of each one.
          I didn't want to learn Ruby in addition to a new framework, I didn't want to be stuck in dependency hell for
          Flask, and Meteor
          seemed a little too bleeding-edge for what I was doing.
          <br>
          <br>
          I built out the "game app" using my bread and butter, vanilla JS (with a little JQuery), Node.js, and
          Socket.io. I hosted a static server using Node.js and created a basic Socket.io backend to handle queries to
          the SQLite database.

          <br>
          <br>

          The GitHub pages for the project can be found <a
            href="https://evinjaff.github.io/speedrunsunchained">here</a>. It's in early alpha right now, but I'm
          hoping that this will eventually become a sweet open-source party game for you and your video-game loving
          friends to play!</p> -->

        </div>

        <p></p>
        <p>For my final project for CSE 204A (Frontend Web Development), we had to build a frontend-only website or
          application using a RESTful API. Out of a need, I decided to build a
          pokedex tracker using the PokeAPI because it's been my goal for a few summers to finish the National
          Pokedex in Pokemon Soul Silver! With this tool, I can track my
          progress as I finally complete my National Dex this Summer. Oh, and one more fun feature, the application
          tracks your completion percentage, and has a share button
          that composes a tweet for you that tells everyone how far you are in your progress to "catch 'em all!"</p>

        <p>On the website, you can check off caught pokemon and hover over a pokemon to see how you can catch/evolve
          it. The
          app also tracks your progress with a JSON file, so the application is technically portable in the sense that
          if you hold on to the exported JSON, you can keep your progress saved. This site is similar
          in a lot of ways to my Fire Emblem Echos Randomizer I built, but I've come
          at it with 1-2 years of wisdom. For example, I used TypeScript instead of vanilla JS with a target
          transpilation of ECMAScript 6 for maintainability. After one project, I'm a TypeScript convert; it is such a
          great resource for
          catching errors and writing stable code. Second, I am using AJAX calls instead of a local database which
          will
          make the
          site run slower but de-bloats the code and makes it more dynamic. Lastly, instead
          of building a monolithic block of JavaScript code like with the Fire Emblem Echoes Randomizer, I used a
          "clean code" style such that many smaller methods were used when possible.</p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, I still made some mistakes. I lost 10 points on the project because my
          website made about 2,400 AJAX requests, which divided by the 493 pokemon means about 4.83 AJAX requests per
          pokemon. Which makes sense considering that sprites, encounter, and evolution data each needed to be
          obtained in
          separate requests. I probably should have made the AJAX data for encounters happen upon request, but I still
          would have needed at minimum 493 AJAX requests and 4 megabytes of data to load the website, and it would
          have only saved me around 4-5 megabytes of data but admittedly 1600 less AJAX requests that could be
          performed after the site loaded.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, a project like this shows the pitfalls of deploying without servers and really the whole Web
          2.0 no-backend
          idea that leaves us with heavy JS websites that perform poorly. It's fun to use APIs, link stuff together,
          and not have to pay AWS, but you get projects like these. If I had used
          Django for this project and
          stored the query in a SQLite database that updated its records from the PokeAPI every month, I could use an
          HTML template to render HTML views on the server-side and provide a lighter front-end experience. This would
          have been much more efficient, especially for an arguably
          static and small dataset like Pokemon.

        <p>I worked with a friend and Professor Bill Siever on an Independent Study focusing on an Abstract Strategy
          Game algorithm analysis based on the game Voltorb Flip. The game is a hybrid of
          minesweeper, sudoku, and nonogram, and the semi-deterministic and semi-probabilistic hybrid makes generating
          efficient solutions on n-dimensional boards difficult. The types of algorithms used to solve the board, such
          as
          A-Star and a modified Sudoku Solver have deeper application in biological simulations of protein folding.
          This
          independent study gave us the chance to explore more complex algorithms involved in high-level
          simulation with limited knowledge as sophomores. </p>

        <p>My final project for CSE 330 was an app called Bearzlet, a Quizlet-like app written from scratch. I built
          the
          site together with Alaina Bohrer. The site uses accounts and upon account creation, the user must verify
          their email address with a special token. Upon login with a verified email, a user is able to create public
          or
          private sets, star sets, as well as study their sets. A user is also able to see statistics on how well they
          are doing on the cards. On any set a user has access to, they can play a write game to study. If a user
          misses cards, they can also "star" difficult cards and play those starred cards.

          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
            The app was written using a diverse stack of languages and frameworks. The frontend was built using
            Vue.js,
            and the page was compiled in Electronjs to build the website to a dedicated desktop binary. The backend of
            the
            application uses PHP and MongoDB to manage the data, and the frontend uses AJAX requests to get data from
            the
            frontend. As an aside, I love MongoDB. It is a beautiful way to run a
            database. Though setting up the MongoDB PHP client with composer was annoying. Our application has been
            tested for
            basic web security and is reasonably safe from SQL/Database Injection, XSS, CRSF forgery, and other
            well-known
            penetration methods.

            <p>Prototype of the HEPA Filter controller using a Raspberry Pi.</p>
          </div>

          <p></p>
          <p>In the Spring of 2020, all Washington University in St. Louis students were sent home. While home in the
            Spring, some students, including my friends and I, had some extra time on our hands. With that extra time,
            a
            team of friends and I got
            together and applied to compete in Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 Design Challenge. We were accepted
            and quickly got to work finding a problem to look at. We quickly settled on hospital infrastructure,
            specifically, the
            use of low-cost and widely
            available HEPA filtration units to create negative pressure rooms, a tool extremely important in
            preventing
            the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals. </p>

          <p>Negative pressure rooms were first used for highly invasive and contamination-prone surgeries like heart
            transplants to
            reduce the spread of bacteria and viruses. Negative pressure rooms have been slowly expanded in hospitals
            for sterile environments. When the COVID-19 pandemic started, HEPA units were proposed to supplement the
            existing expensive systems that induce
            negative pressure which were overloaded. Normally, there is little need to have more than 2-8 negative
            pressure rooms per hospital, but with the rise of COVID-19, the demand for negative pressure rooms
            skyrocketed for patients who were immunocompromised or undergoing non-elective surgeries who were at a
            much higher risk of death from COVID-19 contamination as well as
            for the numerous COVID-19 patients to contain the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the high cost of negative pressure rooms, the solution of HEPA units emerges. They can filter air
            almost as well as expensive negative pressure equipment, and can easily be set up in converted hospitals
            such as Governor Cuomo's "COVID Hotels" in New York for overflow patients.
            However,
            these units are
            inexpensive for a reason; they often require a nurse to check the unit every couple of hours to verify
            that
            the unit is maintaining negative pressure and correct the settings if it's not. With the already high
            workload nurses face, any
            extra
            work might have a
            devastating effect on a nurse's job so we sprang into action to design a device that monitors
            the HEPA filtration unit. </p>

          <p>With our remote situation, I didn't have direct access to a HEPA unit for testing, so as
            the engineer on the team, I
            took a raspberry pi and mimicked a virtual sensor using a USB microphone that had a similar protocol to a
            USB pressure sensor.
            This allowed our group to construct a negative feedback loop and then design a

          <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I really got into Nintendo 3DS homebrew. I also got my wisdom teeth out
            around then, and needed a game to play on my 3DS while recovering. I particularly loved the Fire Emblem
            series, and I really got into Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia. I had already played the game as a
            camp counselor at Camp Parsons about 3 years before, and I really enjoyed it my second time. After
            finishing my playthrough, I decided to
            dive deeper into the game's homebrew scene and I even joined a modding server!

          </p>

          <p>I enjoyed the homebrew scene, but I always hated how when you modded a game, you almost always have to
            download some sketchy .rar with a windows .exe in it. In an effort to buck this trend, I built a web app
            that generated a JSON that could sort of randomize the game through the Paragon editor for Fire Emblem
            echoes. The web app was 100%
            built in vanilla JS, and exports a JSON that you download with no shady .exes. It isn't well because I
            didn't have any formal
            web development experience at this point outside of one high school class. For my
            personal use it worked. With some tinkering I played through a fully randomized campaign and had a fun time.
          </p>

          <br>

          It has been a long time since I worked on this project, and I have no idea if this still works since
          Paragon may have updated itself and since broken JSON compatibility. If you'd like to try it out, you can
          find
          it <a href="https://evinjaff.github.io/FESOV-randomizer/">here</a>.

        <p></p>
        <p>After losing a friend in my community to suicide, I wanted to find a way for technology to aid in suicide
          prevention rather than being a force for evil. I initially wanted to make an Amazon Alexa integration that
          would check in with a
          student every night as a digital therapist. I quickly realized that this was a bad idea and that people
          don't want to talk to tell a robot how they're doing.</p>

        <p>I was worried that my idea had hit a dead end. But when it seemed like I had nothing, I learned about
          Amazon's Internet of
          Things (IoT) Dash Buttons that were the size of a keyfob, but had wifi and could connect to a server across
          the
          internet. The buttons even held a charge for nearly 2 years on a single AAA battery! Because of this amazing
          hardware, I decided to switch to using Amazon's IoT button. </p>

        <p>I used AWS Lambda, AWS IoT, and Twilio to
          relay
          a distress signal to a crisis
          hotline telling them that a user in need of rapid assistance. I was interviewed by <a
            href="https://bit.ly/k5evin">KING 5 News</a>, Seattle's local NBC affiliate, and interviewed by <a
            href="https://bit.ly/evinbutton">Washington University
            in St. Louis' Engineering Magazine</a>. My invention was also featured in the University's Skandilaris
          Center Creator's Gallery. I handed over the source code to the JED Foundation to work with (the foundation
          handles college campus
          suicide prevention for thousands of college campuses). </p>

        <p>An employee of AT&T also caught wind of my project. He was impressed with my work, and shipped me a copy of
          their version of the IoT button to play with. Their version works over the LTE network instead of WiFi,
          which means near 99% coverage of the US and rock-solid reliability for a crisis response device. When I'm
          out of college and have more time, I hope to pick up the project again because it's become even more
          necessary in the years since I started it. </p>

        <h1><a name="NFC"></a>NFC Marketing Case Study, <em>Summer 2018</em></h1>
        <div class="photo">
          <img src="./img/nfc.png" alt="Photo of an NFC Tag">
          <p>Picture of an NFC tag</p>
        </div>
        <p> The same Summer I developed my Connections Button, I became obsessed with NFC tags. I ordered a 100 pack
          of NDEF-Encoded NFC tags from NXP Semiconductors, and after having some fun with using them for automating
          tasks, I wanted to explore
          why the technology saw decent consumer adoption in Europe but saw almost no consumer adoption in America.
          It
          turns out the historical reason for this is due to Apple's hesitation to add NFC support in the iPhone
          models, while Europe has a
          much higher share of Android devices that ship by default with full NFC support. However, with NFC support
          coming to iPhones in early 2019 with the upgrading of <a
            href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corenfc ">CoreNFC in iOS 13</a>, I wanted to experiment
          and see where NFC might find usage. My first thought was with realtors or other low-volume, high-value
          salespeople. I thought that
          realtors could potentially benefit from a "smart" business card or simply an NFC emitter that
          automatically
          added their information to a client's phone as a contact. Due to how few clients realtors have and how
          much
          their clients spend, any
          potential advantage in finding and retaining clients could be a literal million-dollar difference. And as
          a
          salesman, one of the biggest things they attempt is to get their name into a client's phone, something
          that
          NFC makes effortless.
          Most android phones have "appless" NFC reading, which means that without needing to install an app, if an
          NFC tag is near the phone's reader while it is unlocked, the data on the tag will be automatically
          scanned,
          meaning that an
          NFC-enabled business card could be scanned without fumbling for an app on any phone with an NFC reader.
          However, Apple does not support this, and has not showed plans to implement this as of 2022.</p>

        <p>To experiment with this idea, I created several NFC tags and gave them to a luxury hairstylist, a Chanel
          saleswoman, and a realtor. The reception was initially optimistic. However, in all cases, the product was
          eventually rejected in
          for their daily routine with the main reason being support. As previously mentioned, appless NFC reading
          without installing an app is still on its way to being implemented on iOS despite the hardware being
          present. This small case study
          could be considered another example of Apple's mobile market share dictating the success of solutions such
          as NFC. As an alternative to NFC, Apple has implemented native QR code reading in their camera app.</p>

        <p>I later recycled this project into my final project for my Honors History class and for the project also
          talked with realtors about the potential of this technology. I later took this project and wrote it up for
          my final paper and
          presentation for my Honors History class (which also included economics, which is what our final unit was
          on).</p>
