            replacement to existing surgical workflows</p>
        </div>


        <p>While a junior, I was invited to collaborate on a senior design project focused on urologic surgery. The
          client for the senior project, Dr. Nimrod at the Washington University School of Medicine, wanted a solution
          that could detect Iatrogenic Ureteral Injury during an operation. I worked with the team to come up with
          different instrumentation methods, and helped develop and prototype a solution. We considered infrared, x-ray,
          and ultrasound among other ideas until eventually settling on temperature sensing. The idea is for an array of
          thermocouples/thermistors to be placed at various locations near the ureter and inside the stent. This way, if
          one region starts to heat up, we can determine if the scalpel is nearing the ureter and trigger a buzzer or
          other intervention to signal that the scalpel should be removed.

          <br>
          <br>

          <p>We are current prototyping a solution on an Arduino and plan to publish an open-source repository of the
            microntroller code. We will also present a polished prototype at the end of the Spring 2022
          semester. The project website can be found <a

            <p>For the final group project in CSE 237, I as well as another Sophomore and Junior decided to build an Arduino Assembly Interpreter written in Java.
              CSE 237 is a class on programming tools and techniques, so one of the main intentions of the project was to adhere to clean code techniques and best practice planning and contribution 
              models. This included the use of branching and pull requests, a Kanban board, code review, and external peer review. 
            </p>

            <p>The Arduino Assembly interpreter is able to take in a .S assembly file for the AVR instruction set (specifically for the Arduino Uno), and then
              interprets the file and runs it through a virtual CPU to follow the instructions. By the end of the semester, we intend to have the interpreter able
              to run assembly files containing basic arithmetic instructions, simple function calls, and branching. With extra time or if we work fast, we would also love to implement
              a "rewind" function to step back assembly instructions, an option to pause/step execution and insert new assembly lines, and a virtual GPIO pin.

            <p>The SpeedrunsUnchained Logo</p>
          </div>

          <p></p>
          <p>Over my spring break, I chose to stay at University instead of go anywhere fun. While I was there,
            I challenged myself to write a full stack app for my idea of a speedrunning party game. The
            premise is simple enough; a group of friends can go to a website where they can select a few video games,
            input the types of challenges they want, and then a full fledged interface pits people in the group against
            each other in video game challenges.

            <br>
            <br>

            This one app, however, is actually two! There's a "community app" and a "game app." Both
            sites share a common database, and the community app is designed to build and filter out challenges in a
            reddit-like forum, while the game uses the database to actually host the games. The app is open source and thus can be "off-the-grid," meaning that anyone who wants to host this
            version of the app on their local network and keep their own SQLite game database could do that if say a streamer
             wanted to use the app off-network to avoid low-quality submission on a stream.

            <br>
            <br>

            For the "community app," I took this as an opportunity to learn Django, and I can confidently say that I do
            not like Django. Well, I don't dislike Django specifically, it seems really powerful but I find it really
            confusing and inflexible. It seems like the framework is built for exactly one type of thing, and if your
            website doesn't want to do that one thing, you'll be stuck writing hundreds of custom functions to get basic
            things working. In hindsight, I could've tried using Flask, Ruby on Rails, or Meteor, but I had reasons to be wary of each one. 
            I didn't want to learn Ruby in addition to a new framework, I didn't want to be stuck in dependency hell for Flask, and Meteor
            seemed a little too bleeding-edge for what I was doing.
            <br>
            <br>
            I built out the "game app" using my bread and butter, vanilla JS (with a little JQuery), Node.js, and
            Socket.io. I hosted a static server using Node.js and created a basic Socket.io backend to handle queries to
            the SQLite database. Long-term, I am going to convert this JavaScript to TypeScript, just because that's
            becoming the industry standard.

            <br>
            <br>

            The GitHub pages for the project can be found <a
              href="https://evinjaff.github.io/speedrunsunchained">here</a>. It's in early alpha right now, but I'm
            hoping that this will eventually become a sweet open-source party game for you and your video-game loving friends to play!</p>

          <p>I worked with a friend and Professor Bill Siever on an Independent Study focusing on an Abstract Strategy
            Game algorithm analysis based on the game Voltorb Flip. The game is a hybrid of
            minesweeper, sudoku, and nonogram, and the semi-deterministic and semi-probabilistic hybrid makes generating
            efficient solutions on n-dimensional boards difficult. The types of algorithms used to solve the board, such
            as
            A-Star and a modified Sudoku Solver have deeper application in biological simulations of protein folding.
            This
            independent study gave us the chance to explore more complex algorithms involved in high-level
            simulation with limited knowledge as sophomores. </p>

          <p>My final project for CSE 330 was an app called Bearzlet, a Quizlet-like app written from scratch. I built
            the
            side toghether with Alaina Bohrer. The site uses accounts and upon account creation, the user must verify
            their email address with a special token. Upon login with a verified email, a user is able to create public
            or
            private sets, star sets, as well as study their sets. A user is also able to see statistics on how well they
            are doing on the cards. On any set a user has access too, they can play a write game to study. If a user
            misses cards, they can also "star" dificult cards and play those starred cards.

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            The app was written using a diverse stack of languages and frameworks. The frontend was built using Vue.js,
            and the page was compiled in Electronjs to build the website to a dedicated desktop binary. The backend of
            the
            application uses PHP and MongoDB to manage the data, and the frontend uses AJAX requests to get data from
            the
            frontend. As an aside, I love MongoDB. It is a beautiful way to run a
            database. Though setting up the MongoDB PHP client with composer was annoying. Our application has been tested for
            basic web security and is reasonably safe from SQL/Database Injection, XSS, CRSF forgery, and other simple
            penetration methods.

            </div>

            <p></p>
            <p>In the Spring of 2020, all Washington University in St. Louis students were sent home. While home in the
              Spring, some students, including my friends and I, had some extra time on our hands. With that extra time,
              a
              team of friends and I got
              together and applied to compete in Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 Design Challenge. We were accepted
              and quickly got to work finding a problem to look at. We quickly settled on ventilation, specifically, the
              use of low-cost and widely
              available HEPA filtration units to create negative pressure rooms, a tool extremely important in
              preventing
              the inter-patient spread of COVID-19. Negative pressure rooms were first used for invasive surgeries such
              as
              heart transplants to
              reduce the spread of bacteria and other viruses and are used more ubiquitously today in controlling
              contagious and deadly viruses in hospitals. HEPA units replace the existing expensive systems that induce
              negative pressure but are less
              accurate in maintaining negative pressure. Normally, there is little need to have more than 2-5 negative
              pressure rooms per hospital, but with the rise of COVID-19, the demand for negative pressure rooms
              skyrocketed for patients with
              immunocompromised or non-elective surgeries who would die otherwise if they contracted COVID-19 as well as
              for COVID-19 patients. With the high cost of negative filters, the solution of HEPA units emerges.
              However,
              these units are
              inexpensive for a reason; they often require a nurse to check the unit every couple of hours to verify
              that
              the unit is still maintaining negative pressure. With the already high workload that nurses face, any
              extra
              work could have a
              devastating effect on a nurse's ability to work so we sprang into action to design a device that monitors
              the HEPA filtration unit. With our remote situation, I didn't have direct access to a HEPA filter, so as
              the
              engineer on the team, I
              took a raspberry pi and mimic a peripheral sensor using a microphone to simulate high and low voltages as
              a
              sensor might return. This allowed our group to construct a negative feedback loop and then design a
              management system that would
              allow a single Raspberry Pi to control multiple negative pressure rooms. Our invention was well-received,
              and we even had our team's work published in <a href="https://bit.ly/jhu-covid">Washington University's
                Engineering Magazine</a> with
              2 other Washington University teams.</p>

            <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I really got into Nintendo 3DS homebrew. I also got my wisdom teeth out
              around then, and needed a game to play on my 3DS while recovering. I particularly loved the Fire Emblem
              series, and I really got into Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia. I had already played the game as a
              camp counselor at Camp Parsons about 3 years before, and I really enjoyed it my second time. After
              finishing my playthrough, I decided to
              dive deeper into the game's homebrew scene and I even joined a modding server!

            </p>

            <p>I enjoyed the homebrew scene, but I always hated how when you modded a game, you almost always have to
              download some sketchy .rar with a windows .exe in it. In an effort to buck this trend, I built a web app
              that generated a JSON that could sort of randomize the game through the Paragon editor for Fire Emblem echoes. The web app was 100%
              built in vanilla JS, and exports a JSON that you download with no shady .exes. It isn't well written as I didn't have any formal
              computer science or web development experience at this point. But for my personal use... it was a
              success!! With some tinkering I played through a fully randomized campaign. I think that it's kind of silly that people are so particular about
              whether your code meets a standard if you are coding something up for chiefly yourself. Sometimes it's fun to just hack together some code with no standards to make what you want!
              <br>
              <br>

              It has been a long time since I worked on this project, and I have no idea if this still works since
              Paragon may have updated itself and broken JSON compatibility. If you'd like to try it out, you can find it <a

            <p></p>
            <p>After losing a friend in my community to suicide, I wanted to find a way for technology to aid in suicide
              prevention rather than being a force for evil. I initially wanted to make an Amazon Alexa integration that
              would check in with a
              student every night as a digital therapist. However, I later learned that year about Amazon's Internet of
              Things (IoT) Dash Buttons that were the size of a keyfob, yet could connect to a server across the
              internet.
              The buttons were
              resilient too and held a charge for nearly 2 years on a single AAA battery! Because of this amazing
              hardware, I decided to switch to using Amazon's IoT button. I used AWS Lambda, AWS IoT, and Twilio to
              relay
              a distress signal to a crisis
              hotline for the owner of a button in need of rapid assistance. I was interviewed by <a

                href="https://bit.ly/evinbutton">Washington University
                in St. Louis' Engineering Magazine</a>. My invention was also featured in the University's Skandilaris
              Center Creator's Gallery. I handed over the source code to the JED Foundation to work with (the foundation
              handles college campus
              suicide prevention for thousands of college campuses). </p>

              tasks, I wanted to explore
              why the technology saw decent consumer adoption in Europe but saw almost no consumer adoption in America.
              It
              turns out the historical reason for this is due to Apple's hesitation to add NFC support in the iPhone
              models, while Europe has a
              much higher share of Android devices that ship by default with full NFC support. However, with NFC support

                href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corenfc ">CoreNFC in iOS 13</a>, I wanted to experiment
              and see where NFC might find usage. My first thought was with realtors or other low-volume, high-value
              salespeople. I thought that
              realtors could potentially benefit from a "smart" business card or simply an NFC emitter that
              automatically
              added their information to a client's phone as a contact. Due to how few clients realtors have and how
              much
              their clients spend, any
              potential advantage in finding and retaining clients could be a literal million-dollar difference. And as
              a
              salesman, one of the biggest things they attempt is to get their name into a client's phone, something
              that
              NFC makes effortless.
              Most android phones have "appless" NFC reading, which means that without needing to install an app, if an
              NFC tag is near the phone's reader while it is unlocked, the data on the tag will be automatically
              scanned,
              meaning that an
              NFC-enabled business card could be scanned without fumbling for an app on any phone with an NFC reader.
              However, Apple does not support this, and has not showed plans to implement this as of 2022.</p>

            <p>To experiment with this idea, I created several NFC tags and gave them to a luxury hairstylist, a Chanel
              saleswoman, and a realtor. The reception was initially optimistic. However, in all cases, the product was
              eventually rejected in
              for their daily routine with the main reason being support. As previously mentioned, appless NFC reading
              without installing an app is still on its way to being implemented on iOS despite the hardware being
              present. This small case study
              could be considered another example of Apple's mobile market share dictating the success of solutions such
              as NFC. As an alternative to NFC, Apple has implemented native QR code reading in their camera app.</p>

            <p>I later recycled this project into my final project for my Honors History class and for the project also
              talked with realtors about the potential of this technology. I later took this project and wrote it up for
              my final paper and
              presentation for my Honors History class (which also included economics, which is what our final unit was
              on).</p>
