          <h2 class="mb-5">The History of Starkomon</h2>
          <h3>In 2009, amidst attending a strict catholic school that emphasized traditional masculinity. People like Charlie, Jason, Gregory, and I who didnâ€™t like these standards were at the butt end of everything. We all got to choose a syllable to make the logo, and from there we had started. For the first few years, we didn't do anything major until six years later in 2015, when I used the corporation name Starkomon Innovations to register my first AWS account to experiment with developing some Amazon Alexa Skills.</h3>

        <div class="content-section-heading text-center">
        <h1>Winter 010: Fun with MS Paint</h1>
        <img src="img/SI1.jpg">
        <h3>The first stab at making a logo was what the 1960's cyberman in Doctor Who look like, really horrible but at the time I thought I was fine. Of course, you have to give an 11 yeer old some credit for trying!</h3>
        <h1>Fall 2015: Mandatory Logo!</h1>
        <img src="img/logo2.png" width="150px">
        <h3>The original reason why I revived the Starkomon name was because I needed a fake company name when I was signing up for an AWS account. And since "Company McCompanyFace" was taken, I went with Starkomon Innovations with a quickly doctored up logo.</h3>
        <h1>Summer 2016: School Reunion!</h1>
        <img src="img/logo3.png" width="150px">
        <h3>That coming Summer, with the Starkomon name fresh in the head, I met up with my Elementary School Starkomon Executives for a school reunion and we got together and made an updated version of the logo for fun. Bonus Fact: I also used this for a full sized logo for my company on my AWS account.</h3>
        <h1>Fall 2018: Breath of the Wild Inspiration!</h1>
        <img src="img/logo4.png" width="600px">
        <h3>As a big Zelda fan, I loved the Sheikah aesthetic of the font and decided to vector design some of the typography in the same style to use for an updated logo if and when I need it.</h3>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Some things we made</h2>
          <h3>Even though all my friends and I originally created Starkomon to signify we would stay friends after we went to different schools, we still ended up making a lot of things that were impressive for our young ages.</h3>
          <h2>Winter 2010: Starko Notes by Evin and Charlie</h2>
          <img src="img/starkonotes.png" width="600px">
          <h3>Charlie and I came up with the idea of Starko Notes, printed documents chock-full of video game tips and trivia that we then printed on a school copier to sell to fellow students in exchange for their desserts and snacks in their school lunch; we were quite the young entrepreneurs (or conpeople), and generated a fortune of chocolate milk and brownies until our <del>catholic school teachers</del> overlords found out about our plan.</h3>
          <h2>Spring 2010: Starko Comics by Jason and Evin</h2>
          <h3>Intent on continuing to sell our publications for school snacks, we waited for a few months and then went on to draw and make comics of our favorite video game and movie characters to secretly distribute and sell for more snacks.</h3>
          <h2>Winter 2011: The 5th Grader</h2>
          <h3>With all my friends gone at other schools, I wanted to make sure that Starkomon lived on and decided to dip into some journalism. I made a newspaper and branded it: The 5th grader as an underground paper into  </h3>
