              <strong>
                My name is Evin Jaff, I am a Junior at Seattle Academy of Arts & Sciences. I have been member of my school’s Forefront committee since 2016, and I will remain a member of the committee next year.  When I was on the committee last year, I noticed that technology was seen as an negative force rather than a positive asset. I also noticed that one of the hallmarks of a healthy mental and psychological outlook is the ability to feel connected with others for support.  However, technology is often a divider, an isolator, and not always viewed as a connector.  As a programmer, and a techie, I wanted to find a way to use technology for good. 

                I noticed that mental states tended to cluster around three general broad categories: 1). Happy ; 2). Unstable or Trending Unhappy ; 3). Very Unhappy or In Crisis.  In my experience with Forefront, I learned how quickly people could progress between those three states, and how dire the consequences could be when feeling unconnected along the way. I felt there must be some way I could connect people in a low-touch way, continuously, and yet still provide real time action when someone progressed from category 2 to category 3.  I knew that in today’s always-connected world, with an abundance of technology, there had to be a way to make it easy to detect when someone was in those states, and to be able to take quick action when they enter category 3. 

                Last year, I was introduced to a new gadget called the Amazon Dash Button, a small internet-enabled button that, when clicked, is used to immediately order products from Amazon. Usually these buttons are used to reorder replenishable supplies such as toilet paper, detergent, batteries, or even your favorite brand of potato chips. Pretty much anything you could imagine. They are small, and they can be placed anywhere around the house. We had a few of them, and one day. I thought to myself, ‘for all of the hardware packed into that little device, I’m surprised that it’s only being used to order food and batteries.’ I decided to dig deeper, and I found that there was a coding language that could be use to reprogram the buttons to perform more complex functions.  Not only that, but the device could respond differently depending on how you triggered it -- a single click, a ‘double click’, and ‘long press’ -- could all be programmed to perform separate custom actions. Logically, this can be mapped to the 3 states I had envisioned when I had learned about mental states and well being.

          <h1>An Idea is Born</h1>
          
          <h3>The Connection Button uses the same hardware as the Amazon Dash button, repurposed for a special use -- a button that fits on a keyring that students can use in coordination with their counselors and therapist to contact the crisis hotline. Using a button bypasses some of the traditional barriers associated with suicide prevention, namely the friction with placing a phone call to a hotline or to a counselor.</h3>
          <h1>Press it. Log it. Done.</h1> 
            <h3>Every Connection Button has a unique identifier, and is associated with a student’s phone number & email address.  Students could receive the button at the beginning of the school year and are encouraged to carry the button around with them at all times.  To report status, students can  either single tap, double tap, or long press the button depending on how they feel. The single tap sends a signal that the student is feeling great. Double tapping signals that they are feeling uneasy, and long tapping means they are in crisis. The long tap is much different than the other two, because it sends a distress signal to either the local crisis hotline, the assigned counselor, or a designated therapist. Once that distress signal is received, a predetermined set of events follows, usually resulting in an immediate phone call to the associated phone number for that button.  Since this set of events is customizable, a distress signal can simultaneously ring multiple phone numbers, or alert counselors that the student is in distress. Early warning systems can help reach students as soon as they send a distress signal so they can get immediate help and support without the hurdle of having to find the hotline phone number, and make a call.<h3>
          <h1>Behind The Scenes</h1> 
            <h3>The Connection Button prototype uses the same hardware as the Amazon Dash Buttons, which means it has the same specifications.  Currently the Dash buttons require a wifi connection to operate, but to streamline setup, the buttons for a school can be pre-programmed to connect to the school wifi as well as a personal hotspot and home wifi. When a button press occurs, this event is sent to a program that I wrote, which logs the event and, depending on the exact event type, takes action.  For category 1 and 2 events, my program simply logs the events and provides a summary of the count in an administrative dashboard. For category 3 events, the button press is logged and my program uses telephony and SMS services to reach the student immediately. All this runs on a single service running on Amazon Web Services, and can be scaled to accommodate hundreds and thousands of buttons, just like the Amazon Dash button does for millions of Amazon customers today reordering products on Amazon.com. </h3>
          <h1>Development Phases</h1>
          <h2>Beta I</h2>
          <h3>I am currently in the process of gathering feedback on the idea, to determine how useful this concept could be in keeping lines of communication open between students and counselors and hotlines.  Next, I intend to begin meeting with counselors from various schools to distribute beta versions of a prototype button. My plan is to purchase a small number of buttons to distribute to a beta group of users for 30 days. After the private beta program is concluded, I will analyze the problems, and create solutions to resolve issues I learn about during the private Beta.  I intend to start a second Beta based on the lessons I learn during the first Beta. I intend to use standard, off-the-shelf Amazon Dash buttons (approximately $19.99 each).</h3>
          <h2>Beta II</h2>  
          <h3>After the second private beta program, the same error analysis will be performed, and I will work on implementing a few nonessential additions. Unless there are significant concerns, I will work with schools to figure out cost and implementation of a larger program. I will also consider making hardware modifications to the Dash button itself if I uncover limitations in the design. For example, I may need to modify the button hardware to support connecting over Bluetooth or Cellular connections, and not only over WiFi. Such hardware modifications will require extra time and potentially some funding to cover the design changes.</h3>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          </div>

        <h2>What if someone accidentally sits on it?</h2>
        <h3>The contact point for the button is concave, which mitigates the majority of accidental presses. However, if the user is continuously accidentally triggering the button, they could purchase a plastic sleeve to prevent it.</h3>
        <h2>What if the counselor or therapist is on vacation?</h2>
        <h3>If the counselor or therapist is on vacation, the student can arrange with their counselor beforehand to send the distress signal to an alternate counselor, therapist, or they can route it to the crisis hotline.</h3>
        <h2>What if the battery runs out?</h2>
        <h3>Depending on which generation the button is, the button will run on either a small watch battery or one AAA battery. The button lasts about a year, and the button could be taken apart and given a new battery after the battery dies.</h3>
        <h2>Is the button waterproof?</h2>
        <h3>Unfortunately, it is not waterproof. However, many fan-made waterproof sleeves and seals have emerged on the market.</h3>
        <h2>Can it be customized?</h2>
        <h3>Yes, the button’s actions can be customized, usually by each school or group. For example, in a college environment I can imagine that a single tap would send a signal to the student’s Resident Advisor, a double tap would send a signal to Campus Security, and a long tap would send a signal to the campus Crisis Hotline.</h3>
