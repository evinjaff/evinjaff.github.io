          </div>

        
              <strong>From my experience in making NFC products, I already know that NFC is really cool, but when it comes to using it for a wider audience, there aren't a lot of companies that choose to use NFC for marketing or advertising. That is why I have started thinking about multiple applications for NFC. I conducted a few different experiments, I recieved the inspiration after reading a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Axis-Undiscovered-Economics-Everyday/dp/1610393112/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1525780845&sr=8-1&keywords=the+why+axis">The Why Axis</a> by the economist John List, who uses experiments that he conducts to provide evidence for his economic theories. Also, as a big Doctor Who fan, one of my experiments circulates around one of my goals in life to create my own working sonic screwdriver, which I will hopefully have more time in the Summer to work on! Funny enough, the quest to make things from science fiction shows runs in my family, because my father, who is a big Star Trek geek, has a patent for video conferencing on a television, which is a very iconic concept that was introduced to most in Star Trek.</strong>

          <h3>As much as I wish Matt Smith was still the doctor with an alive Rory and Amy, Peter Capaldi is a very fun 12th doctor who has a very cool pair of sonic glasses that function as a sonic screwdriver. As someone who wears glasses and got to experience Google Glass when it was in beta, I've always wanted to make my own smart glasses. When I have more time in the summer, I plan to make some more complex ones, but for the time being, I've thought about ways that a pair of glasses could benefit from having an NFC chip. Now that glasses with thicker frames on the sides are coming back into style, an NFC chip can easily be sticked on to those frames without damaging the chip or impairing its ability to function. I've detailed a few basic types of data that could be stored on an NFC tag to help you.</h3>
          <h1>1. Spending Cash:</h1> 
            <h3>I read a lot of survival guides in my spare time, and nearly all of them advise you to stash some small emergency cash (~$20-30) in a shoelace or under your shoe sole. However, the trick is a bit outdated, and pickpockets and thieves probabaly now anticipate that people hide money in their shoes, so I think the next step is storing a cryptocurrency address on your glasses or make your own prop sonic screwdriver and put the tag in there! Now you can be like the 10th doctor in Doctor Who, who used his sonic screwdriver to quickly grab some cash!<h3>

          <h3>How to make it:</h3> 
            <h3>First, buy some Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency, which I've heard that you can sometimes even buy from your local bank. After you have your cryptocurrency, you can use an app like NFC Tools to encode the Bitcoin address to an NFC tag.</h3>

          <h1>2. Contact Info</h1>
          <h3>If you are worried your NFC business cards are going to "spoil the line of your jacket", then you could very easily put an NFC chip in your glasses. It's the same concept as an NFC business card: you scan your glasses up to a phone and then that phone has the contact info that you stored on the NFC Card.<h3>
          <h3>How to make it: Go to step 6 on my NFC business card tutorial to see how to program the NFC chip. Once that's done, slap an NFC tag on you glasses, and now your glasses are even smarter!</h3>

          <h3>As an extension of what I made above, I programmed an NFC chip for a friend of mine who uses they/them pronouns, and I added their pronouns in parenthesis in the name field. So far, this is one of my favorite applications for using NFC, especially because this highlights a way to use technology for good and not for evil.</h3>

          <h3>From testing different Android operating systems, I've found that some Android operating systems actually react in a specific way to NFC tags that only store a specific address in them, because those operating systems will often directly pull up a maps software with the address inputted to jumpstart navigation.</h3>

              <strong>So far, I have looked at personal applications for NFC, but now I am looking at how NFC can be used to spread information and if you are a business: retain customers. My plan for this circulates around two experiments: one, NFC terminals at restaurants, and two, interactive posters.</strong>

          <h3>From my experience with coding in NFC, my next step was to try and extend my expertise so that my community can be NFC-enabled! In this experiment, I put kiosks with NFC chips in local restaurants around Kirkland to see their sucess. I then had business owners keep the NFC terminals in their restaurant and observe how often the kiosks were scanned in a night. The NFC terminals indicated that you could put the back of a compatible phone near the terminal, and the tag would import the contact information of the restaurant into them. The data I got was below</h3>

          <h1>NFC Posters</h1> 

          <h3>I work with a nonprofit organization called Forefront, which foucuses on suicide prevention targeted at teens and college students. Forefront isn't a very technical organization by any standard, which I thought was a big problem for an organization that wants to help one of the most tech-savy generations. In coordination with my local Forefront chapter, I had some infographic posters about suicide produced that tell you to scan a box that has an NFC tag attached to it. Upon scanning the NFC Tag, the tag imports the contact data for either the Teen Link Textline or the National Suicide Prevention Hotline directly onto your phone without needing to install a software if you are using an Android Phone. From what I have observed, this is why NFC tags are better than any QR Code equivalent, because the barriers to entry are limited. Even though iPhones aren't supported yet, there is still a large portion of students who have Android phones that can use it, because NFC isn't a new technology; Almost every Android phone produced after 2009 has some form of NFC chip inside that allows it to interact with the NFC chip inside the poster without the need to download a companion app! And while the system isn't perfect, the goal of suicide prevention is to break down any barriers possible if it is practical, which is why hotlines like the National Suicide Prevention hotline have a TTY, even though it might not be able to perfectly serve everyone who is hard of hearing. If you'd like to hear more about this, I am going to make a devoted page that is all about this, so when that's working, I'll have a link to it here because I do a lot of stuff like this with forefront.</h3>
