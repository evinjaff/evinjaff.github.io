              <strong>From my experience in making NFC products, I already know that NFC is really cool, but when it comes to using it for a wider audience, there aren't a lot of companies that choose to use NFC for marketing or advertising. That is why I have started thinking about multiple applications for NFC. As a big Doctor Who fan, one of my goals in life is to have a working sonic screwdriver, and I found one way through experimenting with NFC marketing that it could work! Also, this whole thing runs in the family, because my father, who is a big Star Trek geek, has a patent for video conferencing on a television, which is a very iconic concept that was introduced to most in Star Trek.</strong>

          <h3>As much as I wish Matt Smith was still the doctor with an alive Rory and Amy, Peter Capaldi is a very fun 12th doctor who has a very cool pair of sonic glasses that function as a sonic screwdriver. As someone who wears glasses and got to experience Google Glass when it was in beta, I've always wanted to make my own smart glasses. When I have more time in the summer, I plan to make some more complex ones, but for the time being, I've thought about ways that a pair of glasses could benefit from having an NFC chip. Now that glasses with thicker frames on the sides are coming back into style, an NFC chip can easily be sticked on to those frames without damaging the chip or impairing its ability to function. I've detailed a few basic types of data that could be stored on an NFC tag to help you.</h3>
          <h1>1. Spending Cash:</h1> 
            <h3>I read a lot of survival guides in my spare time, and nearly all of them advise you to stash some small emergency cash (~$20-30) in a shoelace or under your shoe sole. However, the trick is a bit outdated, and pickpockets and thieves probabaly now anticipate that people hide money in their shoes, so I think the next step is storing a cryptocurrency address on your glasses. Now you can be like the 10th doctor in Doctor Who who used his sonic screwdriver to quickly grab some cash!<h3>

          <h3>How to make it:</h3> 
            <h3>First, buy some Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency, which I've heard that you can sometimes even buy from your local bank. After you have your cryptocurrency, you can use an app like NFC Tools to encode the Bitcoin address to an NFC tag.</h3>

          <h1>2. Contact Info</h1>
          <h3>If you are worried your NFC business cards are going to "spoil the line of your jacket", then you could very easily put an NFC chip in your glasses. It's the same concept as an NFC business card: you scan your glasses up to a phone and then that phone has the contact info that you stored on the NFC Card.<h3>
          <h3>How to make it: Go to step 6 on my NFC business card tutorial to see how to program the NFC chip. Once that's done, slap an NFC tag on you glasses, and now your glasses are even smarter!</h3>  
          <h1>2b. Pronoun Glasses!</h1>
          <h3>As an extension of what I made above, I programmed an NFC chip for a friend of mine who uses they/them pronouns, and I added their pronouns in parenthesis in the name field. So far, this is one of my favorite applications for using NFC, especially because this highlights a way to use technology for good and not for evil.</h3>

          <h1>3. Take me home!</h1>
          <h3>From testing different Android operating systems, I've found that some Android operating systems actually react in a specific way to NFC tags that only store a specific address in them, because those operating systems will often directly pull up a maps software with the address inputted to jumpstart navigation.</h3>
