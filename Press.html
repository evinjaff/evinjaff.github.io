        <h2>'Smart HEPA filters'</h2>
        <p>Jaff's team aimed to design a more efficient system for monitoring HEPA filters, which help minimize airborne transmission of the virus. His team members included Max Yu, a first-year student in the College of Arts & Sciences; Alaina
          Bohrer, a first-year Engineering student; Brandon Chow, a sophomore in the College of Arts & Sciences; Lilly Gonzalez, a student studying in the School of Law.
          In ideal conditions, all hospitals would have enough negative pressure rooms to minimize the rate of airborne infection, but as the disease progresses, there is a good chance that we will exhaust our supply of negative pressure rooms," Jaff
          said. "An alternative the hospitals can use to meet high demand is using a HEPA-filter system, which induces similar negative pressure but is not nearly as precise and requires more frequent monitoring."</p>

        <p>Team members used microcontrollers and Internet of Things technology to design a system that would automate the required routine monitoring and alert nurses when the system needed manual configuration. Currently, HEPA systems are routinely
          checked by a nurse for any issues and nurses often expend valuable PPE equipment to monitor the systems.</p>

        <p>"Our group focused on automating that process, allowing nurses and health care workers more time to focus on other duties, whether that be taking care of COVID-19 patients or any other sort of work they need to do," Jaff said.</p>

        <h3>Excerpt from McKelvey Engineering Magazine:</h3>

        <p>It's a simple question: How can institutions provide help for people considering suicide?</p>

        <p>For Evin Jaff, a first-year student majoring in biomedical engineering in the McKelvey School of Engineering, the solution arrived the way many things do nowadays: through Amazon.</p>

        <p>After losing a friend to suicide in his sophomore year of high school, he wanted to design a solution that could help prevent future deaths. He'd noticed within his own community that teens had a need for proper mental health resources but
          weren't taking advantage of offered services. Inspired by Amazon's Dash button technology, Jaff developed a product that connects at-risk individuals with the resources they need with the push of a button.</p>

        <h3>Excerpt from KING 5 News:</h3>

        <p>Evin Jaff, a senior at Seattle Academy, has a love for Doritos. He even had the Amazon one-click button for the chips. Then his parents presented him with a challenge.</p>

        <p>“[They asked] is this really the best thing you can be doing with that? Having a button that orders Doritos?” Jaff recalled.</p>

        <p>So, when Jaff got involved with his school’s suicide prevention committee a few months later, he had an idea.</p>

        <p>“With the click of a button it will dial a suicide prevention number for you and connect you with a hotline in under ten seconds.”</p>

        <p>Jaff said the still-unnamed button can break down the barriers that keep people from reaching out for help.</p>

        <p>Though the idea sounds simple – click a button and your phone connects you with a crisis hotline or family member almost instantly -- its purpose could help save lives.</p>
