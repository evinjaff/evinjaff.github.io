              <strong>From making amiibo cards, I've learned that NFC tags can store executable code, which also means it could store loads of other types of data into an NFC tag as long as there is enough space on chip. In this project, I set out to figure out how to encode contact data onto an NFC chip. Then, I printed out a nice business card and then put the chip inside the business card.</strong>

          <h3>Your budget will vary quite a bit depending on the quality of the business card. I spent around $3 on making my first one, and then a solid $1 each for the next ones. <h3>
          <h3> </h3>
          <h3>1. 3M Super 77 Spray Adhesive (I already have a big can that I've been using for two years!)<h3>
          <h3>2. A color printer (A FEDEX printer works really well and it only costs about $1.50 per sheet, and the printers have a high dpi!)<h3>
          <h3>3. Microsoft Word, or some other software to design and create a business card. <h3>
          <h3>4. Some nice paper to print the cards on (I have a lot of friends who are artists and have this paper that they use for painting watercolors. It makes the surface really nice, and they were fine with me grabbing some)</h3>
          <h3>5. NFC Tags (Per unit, they cost around $.50 if you buy them in packs of 50) I used NTAG 215 Protocol tags, but I'm sure that most kinds of NFC tags would work for this.</h3>
          <h3>6. A way to cut the paper (The FEDEX Office that I used had a paper cutter that you can use for free! However, you have to be incredibly precise because poor craftsmanship won't reflect well on you if you intend to give these to people)</h3>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Making the Cards</h2>
          <div class="content-section-heading text-left">
          <h3>1. First, figure out how you are going to attach the NFC chip to your business card. You can either have a card where the NFC chip is invisible or visible. For a picture comparission, there's a picture below. If you don't mind having an NFC chip on the outside of your card like in the left picture, then you will have much more flexiblity in how your card looks, because you will be able to use a service like Vistaprint to print professional-quality business cards. If you take this route, then you can pretty much stop reading and click the button below the picture to skip all the way down to step 6. If you are like me, though, and really want the chip to not be visible, then you will have to do some extra work and make the card yourself.</h3>
          
          <div class="content-section-heading text-center">
          <img src="img/comp.JPG" style="width:1050px">

          <a class="btn btn-primary btn-xl js-scroll-trigger" href="#about">I don't care if the NFC tag is visible, take me to step 6</a>
        </div>
          <h3>2. So, if you're reading step 2, then that means you are going to make the cards yourself. You have the toal freedom to make it yourself, but I would reccomend keeping a minimalist look for the cards, because sometimes you lose track of how little text can really go on a card that small. Since we are going to make the card invisible, both sides of the card must be printed single-sided and then glued together with the NFC chip inside it.<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wXgV3QWXwmjlbV_m6F6lxwSOxxDExofu/view?usp=sharing"> Here is a Google Drive link to a Microsoft Word template that I used.</a></h3>
          <h3> </h3>
          <h3> </h3>
          <h3>3. Now that you've hopefully made a good business card, get it printed! Make sure that you are careful in how you export the file, because when I first tried it, I exported it in a .docx file, and the font didn't load, so it defaulted to Times New Roman. To circumvent this, you have to go under the export tab in the file menu and export it as a PDf/XPS document using a high-resolution output for printing. By using that, I didn't have any issues with loading the fonts.</h3>

          <img src="img/Printer.jpg" style="width:3078px">
          </div>
          <h3>4. Now it's time to cut the cards out! Since this card is a professional reflection of you, I would reccomend using a high quality paper cutter for the straightest cut.</h3>
          <div class="content-section-heading text-center">
          <img src="img/cut.jpg" style="width:800px">
          </div>
          <h3>5. Now, you have to attach both the NFC Tag and both sides of business card to each other. I reccomend using 3M Super 77 spray adhesive to attach the cards because the bond between the cards is really strong, and it doesn't leave a big odor. Of course, the differences are fairly minimal, and any adhesive should work. To use the Super 77, first stick the NFC tag onto the inside part of the card for where you want it to be scanned, and then spray the contact cement onto the two sides that won't be visible. Once the cement is tacky, then stick the two sprayed sides together. Finally, wait 5-10 minutes for the contact cement to cure</h3>

          <section class="content-section" id="about">


          <h3>6. Now that you have your business card made, either by making it yourself or getting it pre-printed, it's time to program it! There are a lot of ways to do it, but the easiest way would be to use an Android app because most Android phones have NFC chips installed in them. I would recommend using an app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc&hl=nl">NFC Tools</a>, which is free on Google Play. NFC tools will let you store a good variety of data, from contact info to Bitcoin addresses.</h3>
          <div class="content-section-heading text-center">
          <img src="img/nfctools.JPG" style="width:400px">
          </div>
          <h3>7. Now it's time to encode contact data onto the NFC tag! Depending on the app you use, the process will vary. Since we are optimizing for mobile phones, we will be using a file formate called a Vcard. It is essentially like you just wrote down your info in a text file. Vcards are designed take up as little space as possibe; the example one below only takes up 128 bytes of data, which is six million 78 thousand and 125 times the amount of disk space that Star Wars IV: A New Hope encoded as an mp4 file takes up.</h3>
          <h3>Example Vcard:</h3>
            <pre>     BEGIN:VCARD
     BEGIN:VCARD
     N:Doctor;The;;Dr.;
     ADR;DOM;PARCEL;HOME:;;1 TARDIS Ln;;;00000;Gallifrey
     EMAIL;INTERNET:none@gmail.com
     END:VCARD
<h3>Output:</h3>

  </pre>
          <h3>8. If you are using NFC tools, click "Add a record" and then scroll down and select "Contact". After that, enter your information and then once everything is ready, press write and then put your NFC tag up to the NFC sensor. Once everything is written, you will now have a fully functional business card.</h3>
