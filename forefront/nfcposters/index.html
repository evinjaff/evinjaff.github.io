          <h2 class="mb-5">What I did and why</h2>
        
              <strong>Younger kids around me love these toys-to-life video games, where the games reward the user for owning many of their figurines, because the figurines have a chip inside them that give in-game items, new characters, and other content hidden behind this paywall. And often, having only one figure isn't enough. Normally, you need a fleet of them to do well in the game. To me, I don't think that's fair, because you shouldn't need to spend hundreds of dollars to acess all the content in a game. In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, one of my favorite games, the game locks Link's personal horse, outfits from previous games, and other cool weapons behind figurines that aren't even available any more. That's where what I made stops this injustice! I purchased the NFC chips that are inside the figures for under 60 cents each, and that cost would even be lower if you purchased more in bulk. It's much lower than the 12.99 price tag that sits on most Nintendo-made amiibos. To illustrate my point about the many items locked behind these expensive figurines, this graphic shows the items that each figure provides</strong>

          <h3> </h3>
          <h3>1. 3M Super 77 Spray Adhesive (I already have a big can that I've used for two years. I bought mine on clearance for $5 but it will last!<h3>
          <h3>2. A color printer (A FEDEX printer works really well and it only costs about $1.50 per sheet, and the printers have a high dpi!)<h3>
          <h3>3. Paint.net or another graphic design software<h3>
          <h3>4. Some nice paper to print the cards (I have a lot of friends who are artists and have an excess of cardstock and they were more than happy for me to grab some)</h3>
          <h3>6. NFC Tags (~$9)</h3>

          <h3>5. A way to cut the paper (The FEDEX Office that I used had a paper cutter that you can use for free!)</h3>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Making the Cards</h2>
          <div class="content-section-heading text-left">
          <h3>1. First, figure out your design for the NFC Cards. I made some inspired by some images I've seen online. There's no way to make a "wrong" design; have fun designing something if you like that kind of thing! I drew a lot of inspiration from this image:</h3>
          <div class="content-section-heading text-center">
          <img src="img/Inspiro.jpg" style="width:1148px">
          </div>
          <h3>If design isn't your strong suit, then I would reccomend using <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/compcs-amiibo-cards.413508/">this gallery</a> and <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/custom-amiibo-cards-for-botw.464093/">this gallery</a> for pre-made designs. I would reccomend doing what I did and wait to make your own designs for the second batch, but once you get the process down, go for it!</h3>
          <h3> </h3>
          <h3> </h3>
          <h3>2. Next, paste your designs prepared to be printed! I used Microsoft Word, because they make it easy to proportionally change the size of the image using inches instead of pixels. Once Once everything is ready to go, put it onto a flash drive to go to FEDEX or send it to your printer!</h3>
          <div class="content-section-heading text-center">
          <img src="img/Printer.jpg" style="width:3078px">
          </div>
          <h3>3. Then, gaze in awe as you wait for your cards to arrive. Also, make sure that you don't smudge them, because some color printers spit out the paper when it's still hot, which can lead to you smudging the ink!</h3>
          <div class="content-section-heading text-center">
          <img src="img/Deliver.jpg" style="width:1600px">
          </div>
          <h3>4. Now it's time to cut the cards out! Be very careful to not cut along the sides of the card. Also, don't be like me and use scissors. I butchered the cut and had to back and reprint the cards!</h3>
          <div class="content-section-heading text-center">
          <img src="img/cut.jpg" style="width:800px">
          </div>
          <h3>5. Finally, stick the NFC tag onto one side of the card, and then spray the contact cement onto the two cards. Once the cement is tacky, then stick the two cards together. Then, wait 5-10 minutes for the contact cement to cure</h3>
          <div class="content-section-heading text-center">
          <img src="img/alm.jpg" style="width:800px">
          </div>

          <h3>6. Now that the card works, you'll need NFC files to load onto the tags. There are a lot of sources online that have the NFC code, but one really good one is <a href="https://nfc-bank.com">nfcbank.com</a></h3>
          <h3>7. Finally, you have to load the NFC data onto the tags using an app called Tagmo for Android. After you get the app installed, you have to upload two bin files that you can find <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7USDVlwa5stY1o5ZF9odXRZeEU/view?usp=sharing">here</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7USDVlwa5stRFZZdmJWQmNsUTQ/view">here. </a> After that's done, you can press "load tag" to load the nfc file, and then click "write tag" to write the data to the NFC tag.</h3>

          <img src="img/tagmo.png" style="width:600px">
          </div>
          <h3>8. Now you should hopefully have some awesome amiibos that you can use to circumvent the $13 price tag!</h3>
