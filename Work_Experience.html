    <h1>Washington University in St. Louis, <em>Teaching Assistant, Spring 2020</em></h1>

      Teaching Assistant and grader for Washington University's Data Structures and Algorithms Course.

      <h1>Department of Defense: Project Tesseract, <em>Unpaid Fellow, Summer 2020</em></h1>

      <p>
        Project Tesseract is an effort by the United States Department of Defense to gain insights from recruited fellows in academia on emerging fields and for the fellows to work on projects related to the research of emerging technologies.</p>

      <p>
        While an unpaid fellow, I prototyped a vending system for tools to accelerate the speed of maintenance operations on a military base's Flightline. I also worked on a sub-team to develop a system to allow for autonomous robots to operate inside a hangar among humans similar to Amazon fulfillment centers. I also presented a report of the robot system to Brigadier General Linda Hurry, where it was positively received.  </p>

      <p>OsteoPOP was a student startup led by Biomedical Engineering Ph.D. student Ian Berke. OsteoPOP focused on finding a solution to the low compliance rate of bisphosphonate medications prescribed to elderly women for the treatment of Osteoporosis. </p>
      <p>Our team spaned a wide array of disciplines, including students skilled in Biomedical Engineering like Ian and I, an Electrical and Systems Engineering Student proficient in sensors, two Economics Ph.D. students studying incentives, and MBA students studying the market of a potential solution. </p>
      <p>Our solution was a device with an optional pack-in application that tracked compliance and educated the user on the importance of their medication as well as auto-requested a prescription refill for them if they consented to it. As an Engineering Lead, I managed the development schedule and still worked as an engineer helping with the development of a prototype, which included microcontroller programming, Computer-Aided Design (CAD), and App Development. Our final result was simple, yet effective; a pill cap sensor that was equipped with a LIDAR sensor and 3D Dot Projection that could estimate the number of pills left in the bottle accurately enough to determine whether a medication was taken and if a refill would soon be required. The resulting device was filed for a <a href="https://evinjaff.github.io/papers/Berke,%20Jaff,%20Martin%20-%202020.pdf">provisional patent co-authored by Evin Jaff, Ian Berke, and Caleb Martin</a> (the three main students working on prototyping the device). The prototype was presented at multiple entrepreneurship events, including TigerLaunch, and Washington University's Olin School of Business' Idea Bounce where it was a finalist in both. The student startup disbanded, however, after Ian was awarded his Ph.D. in the Spring of 2019.</p>

      <p>While interning at the Stone Lab in the Medical School's Otolaryngology Department, I worked under a graduate student to prepare and analyze inner-ear samples. I learned standard lab skills, as well as complex protocols for how to properly "defrost" biological samples stored for years in sub-zero freezers and the handling of dangerous chemicals such as Formaldehyde. While an intern, I also attended multiple research conferences and met with colleagues of the lab to learn more about medical research </p>
