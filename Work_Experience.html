    <h1>Washington University in St. Louis, <em>Teaching Assistant, Spring 2020</em></h1>

    <p>
      Teaching Assistant and grader for Washington University's Data Structures and Algorithms Course.

      <h1>Department of Defense: Project Tesseract, <em>Unpaid Fellow, Summer 2020</em></h1>

      <p>
        Project Tesseract is an effort by the United States Department of Defense to gain insights and fellows from academia and industry to work on projects related to research of emerging technologies.
      </p>

      <p>
        While an unpaid fellow, I prototyped a vending system for tools to accelerate the speed of maitenace operations on the flightline. I also worked on a sub-team to develop a system to allow for autonomous robots to operate inside a hangar among humans similar to Amazon fulfillment centers. I also presented a report of the robot system to Brigadier General Linda Hurry, where it was positively recieved.

      <p>OsteoPOP was a student startup led by Biomedical Engineering PhD stuent Ian Berke. OsteoPOP focused on finding a solution to the low compliance rate of bisphosphonate medications perscribed to elderly women for treatment of Osteoporosis. </p>
      <p>Our team spaned a wide array of disciplines, including stuents skilled in Biomedical Engineering like Ian and I, Electrical and Systems Engineering Students working on Sensors, Economics PhD students studying incentives, and MBA students studying the market of a potential solution. </p>
      <p>Our solution was a device with an optional pack-in application that tracked compliance and educated the user on the importance of their medication as well as auto-requested a persception refill for them if they consented to it. As an Engineering lead, I worked with the Electrical Engineering Studetns and the Biomedical Engineering students on developing a prototype, which included microcontroller programming, Computer-Aided Design (CAD), and App Development. Our final result was simple, yet effective; a pill cap sensor that was equipped with a LIDAR sensor and 3D Dot Projection that could estimate the amount of pills left in the bottle accurately enought to detemine whether a medication was taken, and if a refill would soon be required. The resulting device was filed for a provisional patent co-authored by Evin Jaff, Ian Berke, and Caleb Martin (the three main students working on prototyping the device). The prototype was presented at multiple entrepreneurship events, including TigerLaunch, and Washington University's Olin School of Business' Idea Bounce where it was a finalist in both. The student startup disbanded, however, after Ian was awarded his PhD in the Spring of 2019. </p>

      <p>While interning at the Stone Lab in the Medical School's Otolayngology Department, I worked under a graduate student to prepare and analyze inner-ear samples. While an intern, I also attended multiple research conferences and met with colleauges of the lab to learn more about medical research </p>
